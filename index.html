<p>Please apply to this program using <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScTbvt6PDbA0Yl48tAhDdC-FuLOXxlI48H6hrQLZfCmc1IxIA/viewform?usp=sf_link">this form</a> before <strong>February 28, 2022</strong>.
We aim to select a group of about 30 participants with a range of expertise and interests based on these applications and, since we expect this process to be oversubscribed, we plan on selecting participants using the &ldquo;entrofy&rdquo; method (see <a href=https://github.com/dhuppenkothen/entrofy>dhuppenkothen/entrofy</a> and <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03314>arXiv:1905.03314</a> for more details).
The inputs for this process will be the responses to the multiple choice questions on the application form, and a set of target distributions for each category.</p>

<h1 id=about>About</h1>
<p><strong>What this workshop is</strong> => This will be a week-long workshop and unconference, where we will discuss and learn about the finer details of managing and contributing to open source software projects in astronomy. This program aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>build a network of astronomers who participate in the open source community, through contributions including code, documentation, support, management, and many other aspects of this ecosystem,</li>
<li>identify ways that we, as a community, can promote and support astronomical software development, and the people who do it, and</li>
<li>discuss some high-level technical topics specific to scientific software development (e.g. development workflows/infrastructure, testing best practices, academic credit, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>Serious code development experience is not a prerequisite for this meeting, and we value the perspectives of scientific software developers, managers, users, advocates, and all other members of this community. We do not expect all participants to be expert coders, and we encourage you to apply to the workshop regardless of your coding experience level.</p>
<p><strong>What this workshop isn&rsquo;t</strong> => This workshop is not going to focus on specific tools, programming languages, or introductory software development topics. There are detailed software development workshops, courses, and resources out there that we don’t want to recreate (we have included a list of some examples at the end of this message), so this unconference is not meant to be a place to learn about how to use computing tools (e.g. git, Python, or even topics in high-performance or GPU computing). Similarly, we’re not going to focus on a specific branch of modeling or technique (e.g. “big data,” machine learning, Gaussian Processes).</p>
<p><strong>The program</strong> => This workshop will feature lectures and/or facilitated thematic discussions in the mornings, followed by afternoons of unstructured collaboration/discussion/co-working time. The daily topics, speakers, and facilitators are yet to be determined, but they will fall into the broad set of topics discussed above. The afternoons will be participant-driven, so you will have the opportunity to lead and join discussions on topics of your choosing, or try implementing ideas discussed in the morning sessions. We expect that all participants will actively participate in these hands-on sessions to the full extent that makes sense for them.</p>

<h1 id=logistics>Logistics</h1>
<p>Our current plan is for this workshop to be primarily held in person at the <a href=https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics>Center for Computational Astrophysics</a> in New York City, May 16–20, 2022. We will stream and record the plenary sessions to enable virtual or asynchronous participation in some aspects of the program, but we don’t plan to support fully virtual access to the afternoon sessions. In the case where this is not a feasible attendance option for you, please get in touch, and we will do our best to accommodate your needs.</p>
<p>Attendance at this workshop is limited to approximately 30 participants and, given the large number of people who signed up for this mailing list, we expect more applications than we can accommodate. In this case, we will select participants based on the application form, with the goal of selecting a diverse group of participants.</p>
<p>We anticipate having funding to support travel and/or accommodation costs for some participants, and you will have an opportunity to request this support after participant selection.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact <a href=mailto:dforeman-mackey@flatironinstitute.org>Dan Foreman-Mackey</a>, the chair of the organizing committee, with any comments, questions, or suggestions!</p>
